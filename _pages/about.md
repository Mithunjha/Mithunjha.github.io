Hi there! My name is Mithunjha Anandakumar. I am a first-year Ph.D. student in [Bio engineering](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.

I was a joint post-baccalaureate research fellow at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. My research involved developing deep learning algorithms to reconstruct microscopic images with [Dr. Dushan Wadduwage](https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd), [Wadduwage Lab](https://wadduwagelab.com/), Harvard University and protein structure generation with of [Dr. Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8KJ9gf4AAAAJ&hl=en), [SO lab](https://site.solab.org/home), Harvard University. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering from [Department of Electronic and Telecommication](https://ent.uom.lk/), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka, in 2022. I completed my thesis on "Interpretable multi-modal sleep monitoring system using Ear EEG and EOG" with [Dr. Anjula De Silva](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-anjula-de-silva/), University of Moratuwa, [Dr. Chamira Edussooriya](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-chamira-u-s-edussooriya/), University of Moratuwa and [Dr. Simon Lind Kappel](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-lind-kappel(ac38d32d-9622-4bf6-9103-1d9225c5322c).html), Aarhus University. I gained industry experience as a trainee biomedical research engineer at Zone24x7, developing biosignal processing algorithms to extract Breathing Rate (BR) from ECG and PPG.

I aspire to work towards developing cutting-edge machine learning methods for advancing medicine and healthcare. I have keen interest on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, and Biosignal Processing.
