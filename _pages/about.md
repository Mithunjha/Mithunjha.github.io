Hi there! My name is Mithunjha Anandakumar. I am a post baccalaureate research fellow at Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. Currently my research work involves developing deep learning algorithms to reconstruct microscopic images with [Dr. Dushan Wadduwage](https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd), [Wadduwage Lab](https://wadduwagelab.com/), Harvard University and protein structure generation/ modeling with of [Dr. Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8KJ9gf4AAAAJ&hl=en), [SO lab](https://site.solab.org/home), Harvard University. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Biomedical engineering from [Department of Electronic and Telecommication](https://ent.uom.lk/), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2022. I completed my thesis on "Interpretable multi-modal sleep monitoring system using Ear EEG and EOG" with [Dr. Anjula De Silva](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-anjula-de-silva/), University of Moratuwa, [Dr. Chamira Edussooriya](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-chamira-u-s-edussooriya/), University of Moratuwa and [Dr. Simon Lind Kappel](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-lind-kappel(ac38d32d-9622-4bf6-9103-1d9225c5322c).html), Aarhus University. I gained industry experience working as an trainee biomedical research engineer at Zone24x7, developing algorithms for stress detection using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters, and algorithms for Breathing Rate (BR) derivation from ECG and PPG.

I am aspired to work towards developing AI methods to improve healthcare and medical knowledge. I have keen interest on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, Signal Processing and Genomics.

**Update : I'm applying for PhD positions for 2023 Fall intake. Please do get in touch if you think I'm a good fit for your lab.**
