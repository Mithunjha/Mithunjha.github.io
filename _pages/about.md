Hi there! My name is Mithunjha Anandakumar. I am a post baccalaureate research fellow at Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University. Currently my research work involves developing deep learning algorithms to reconstruct microscopic images with [Dr. Dushan Wadduwage](https://centerforadvancedimaging.harvard.edu/people/dushan-wadduwage-phd), [Wadduwage Lab](https://wadduwagelab.com/), Harvard University and protein structure generation/ modeling with of [Dr. Sergey Ovchinnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8KJ9gf4AAAAJ&hl=en), [SO lab](https://site.solab.org/home), Harvard University. 

I received my bachelor's degree in Biomedical engineering from [Department of Electronic and Telecommication](https://ent.uom.lk/), University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka in 2022. I completed my thesis on "Interpretable multi-modal sleep monitoring system using Ear EEG and EOG" with [Dr. Anjula De Silva](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-anjula-de-silva/), University of Moratuwa, [Dr. Chamira Edussooriya](https://ent.uom.lk/team/dr-chamira-u-s-edussooriya/), University of Moratuwa and [Dr. Simon Lind Kappel](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/simon-lind-kappel(ac38d32d-9622-4bf6-9103-1d9225c5322c).html), Aarhus University. I gained industry experience working as a trainee biomedical research engineer at Zone24x7, developing algorithms to extract Breathing Rate (BR) from ECG and PPG, also an algorithm for stress detection using Heart Rate Variability (HRV) parameters.

I am aspired to work towards developing AI methods to improve healthcare and medical knowledge. I have keen interest on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, Medical Imaging, Signal Processing and Genomics.

**Update : I'm applying for PhD positions for 2023 Fall intake. Please do get in touch if you think I'm a good fit for your lab.**
